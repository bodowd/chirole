								<h4>About this site</h4>
								<p>Chirole is a job board focused on jobs that are at the intersection of chemistry, software development, data science, and machine learning.</p>

								<h4>Looking for a challenging job where you can tackle problems in drug discovery, materials science, and other chemistry related fields?</h4>
								<p>For job seekers who want to leverage their machine learning, data science, and programming skills to solve tough chemistry problems, you can easily find and apply to those types of jobs here.</p>

								<h4>Need to fill an open position?</h4>
								<p>Other job boards are too unspecific, and your job posts get drowned out making it hard for qualified candidates to find.</p>
